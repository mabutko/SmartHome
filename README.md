# SmartHome
Open source IoT implementation of Smart Home system 

In this project all used technologies and components required for implementation of 
smart house system with remote control are described. Principles of IoT concept and
communication protocols are described. Arduino board is used for connection with IoT
devices such as sensors or shields and for implementation of program code for control
of a system. Wemos D1 mini board is used for connection of the Arduino board to a 
MQTT Cloud service. Program code is explained in details and implementation of user 
application is described in mobile application MQTT Dash.

Keywords: 	Internet of Things (IoT), smart house, microcontroller, Arduino, 
			Wemos D1 mini, serial communication, cloud, Cloud MQTT, MQTT Dash
